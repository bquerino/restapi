# restapi
Super simple CRUD using Springboot + Mysql

This example of code helps to create a simple API with basic HTTP methods to perform a simple CRUD.

If you have docker installed, you can install the mysql image and run through this command:

```bash
docker run -it --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql -p 3306:3306 -d mysql
```
Note if you run this command, the same application.properties of this current repo will work. ;)
